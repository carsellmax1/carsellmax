## Mailinator for Onboarding Flow Testing

**Overview**
Mailinator is a disposable email testing service. It provides public inboxes at the `@mailinator.com` domain (and private/custom domains for paid accounts). Emails sent to these addresses arrive instantly and can be read via the Mailinator web UI or API ‚Äî no password required for public inboxes.

It‚Äôs commonly used by dev teams to test:

* Signup and onboarding flows
* Verification emails
* Password reset processes
* Transactional notifications

‚ö†Ô∏è Since inboxes are public and ephemeral, Mailinator should **not** be used for sensitive data. It‚Äôs strictly for QA, automation, and development pipelines.

**Our Use Case**
We use Mailinator addresses (e.g. `yswessi@redcastlecp.com`) to simulate **new user signups**. This allows us to:

1. Confirm that the onboarding flow correctly sends a verification email.
2. Validate that the AI tutorial begins only after verification is complete.

**Test Account**

* **Login URL:** [https://www.mailinator.com/v4/login.jsp](https://www.mailinator.com/v4/login.jsp)
* **Test Inbox Email:** `yswessi@redcastlecp.com`
* **Password:** `AfdalX@2020`

Currently, the inbox is empty. You can also test by sending emails to:
`[ANYTHING]@team76432.testinator.com`

## Directions for Local AI Onboarding Flow Test

1. **Generate a New Test User**

   * In your local environment, trigger the **signup process** with a test email, for example:

     ```
     testuser123@team76432.testinator.com
     ```

2. **Check Mailinator Inbox**

   * Go to [Mailinator Login](https://www.mailinator.com/v4/login.jsp).
   * Log in using:

     * Email: `yswessi@redcastlecp.com`
     * Password: `AfdalX@2020`
   * Navigate to the target inbox (e.g. `team76432.testinator.com`) to find the verification email.

3. **Validate Verification Email**

   * Ensure that the onboarding system sends the **verification email** immediately.
   * Confirm that the email contains the **correct link/token**.

4. **Complete Verification**

   * Click the verification link inside the Mailinator inbox.
   * Validate that the user is now marked as **verified** in the system.

5. **AI Tutorial Trigger**

   * After verification, confirm that the AI tutorial or onboarding sequence starts as expected.
